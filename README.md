I would call myself a Jack of all trades. 
I love exploring technologies, even if I can't end up making them a part of my professional career.
I love thinking about user behaviors and how to make good products and features.

I love to write about some of these on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@jjmayank98) blog.
Some of my major publications :
[Understanding Typescript — Dependency & Dev Dependency](https://medium.com/@jjmayank98/typescript-dependency-or-dev-dependency-cad623dff6d5)
[Fixing India’s Last mile delivery](https://medium.com/@jjmayank98/last-mile-delivery-fixing-logistics-indian-software-developers-version-cc676397b61c)
[Sync shopping carts across devices and platforms ?](https://medium.com/@jjmayank98/sync-shopping-carts-across-devices-and-platforms-53c62e4a9344)

I have also started a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mankuDevJS)  channel to learn about web development starting from the very basics of JavaScript.
I do it in my local language Hindi.
